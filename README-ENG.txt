Operating instructions:



There are two characters in the game: light blue squares and deep blue squares, each controlled by "WASD" and "↑↓←→".



Among them, the dark blue square grabs the light blue square.




After opening the game, 5 options will appear, which can be selected by pressing the up and down keys.



2. After starting the game (Start), the map option will appear (the map submission has been opened). Due to input buffer reasons, you may need to input twice (we apologize for any inconvenience and will optimize it in the future). Pressing a space in the game will pause the game.

3. Set to set the theme, brightness, speed, countdown, gameplay, and window size.



'+' mode:



A special colored square will appear on the map, and as long as any person is next to it, the speed of time passing will accelerate.



'Hide Wall' mode:

Hide the wall. It's not fun.



'Explore' mode:

At the beginning, it was dark, and the places you walked by would be displayed.



Alright, speaking of this, we can start the game now.



One person catches another person, catches them, the game is over. I didn't catch it, the countdown is over, and the game is over.



After the game is over, two options will appear, 1 is to have another game, and 2 is to exit the game.



Due to hardware reasons, we are currently unable to update the Win10 version. If you want to experience it, you can only make do with You catch and I run! 3.3 Use (you can find it on my blog), or wait for a compatible version of Win10 to appear. I deeply apologize for this!



This concludes the explanation of the garbage game. Wishing everyone a happy trip!
